# Memory Bank PLAN Mode Workflow

## Critical Rules

- When entering PLAN mode, first READ ALL Memory Bank files to establish complete context
- Check if Memory Bank files are complete with sufficient information
- If files are incomplete, create a comprehensive plan for completing them
- If files are complete, verify context is current and accurate
- Develop a clear strategy based on complete Memory Bank information
- Present a structured approach that addresses current project priorities from activeContext.md
- Document all planning steps in chat as a record for future reference
- Any new insights or decisions from planning must be updated in activeContext.md
- Next steps from planning should align with progress.md's work items

## Examples

<example>
User: Let's start planning the next feature.
Assistant: I'll help plan the next feature. First, let me review all Memory Bank files to get the full context.
*Reads projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md*
Based on the Memory Bank files, I can see that our next priority is [feature from activeContext]. I suggest the following approach:
1. [Strategy point 1 based on Memory Bank content]
2. [Strategy point 2 based on Memory Bank content]
3. [Strategy point 3 based on Memory Bank content]
This approach aligns with our current focus from activeContext.md and addresses the next steps in progress.md.
