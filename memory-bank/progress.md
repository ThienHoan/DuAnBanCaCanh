*What's left to build:*
- Complete project structure and architecture
- Backend API implementation
- Frontend user and admin interfaces
- Authentication and authorization system
- Integration with payment and shipping services
- Image upload and management system
- Deployment pipeline

*Current status:*
- Planning phase - defining project structure based on database schema
- No code implementation yet
- Database schema is complete and includes sample data

*Known issues:*
